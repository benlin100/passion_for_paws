For my project, I worked closely with Belinda Hair, Executive Assistant of the Austin Animal Center, to understand their goals and how they want to leverage their data.  My project focused on using the Austin Animal Center's Kaggle dataset to classify if an animal will be staying in the Center for a short, average, or long time. Using these predictions, Belinda can split the Center in 3 sections, so the employees and volunteers can better allocate their time and resources accordingly.
